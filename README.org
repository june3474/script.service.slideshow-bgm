** 2. Interconnect to skin
*slideshow-bgm* script needs to be interconnected to the skin to work properly. 
Technically, interconnecting is done by inserting a xml tag below in the ~SlideShow.xml~ file of the current skin,
and it is automatically performed after *slideshow-bgm* being installed or enabled.
In this way, *slideshow-bgm* runs only while playing slideshow, rather than all the time while *Kodi* runs.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<onload condition="System.HasAddon(script.slideshow-bgm) + System.AddonIsEnabled(script.slideshow-bgm)">RunAddon(script.slideshow-bgm)</onload>
#+END_EXAMPLE
However, if you are using the default skin(~estuary~ as of Kodi v19) on linux, it might not be able to insert the tag 
due to the permission problem.
In that case, *slideshow-bgm* will inform you and you will need to manually edit the ~SlideShow.xml~ file.
See the pictures below.

If you are really reluctant to manually edit ~SlideShow.xml~ of the default skin though, you can alternatively 
install another skin *before* installing slideshow-bgm. 

Since non-default skins are intalled in your private ~addons~ directory, there will be no permission problem.
As you might already know, there are so many awesome skins such as

** 3. Configure
The last step is to choose your bgm. Go to the configure screen of *slideshow-bgm* and select a music playlist 
or a directory containning music files. If you choose a directory, slideshow-bgm will create a playlist(~bgm.m3u~) 
in [[https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata#addon_data][addon_data folder]] for you. 
That's it. Enjoy!

** Troubleshooting
*** slideshow-bgm keeps playing the same music from the beginning
In most cases, this happens due to corrupted or abnormally encoded audio files. 
They seem to fail ~SeekTime()~ function of kodi which uses ffmpeg/libav internally; 
and ~SeekTime()~ ends up on time 0, the beginning of the file. Take a look at the example below:

**** A sample audio file
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ffprobe version 4.2.4 Copyright (c) 2007-2020 the FFmpeg developers
Input #0, mp3, from 'sample.mp3':
  Metadata:
    major_brand     : 3gp4
    minor_version   : 512
    compatible_brands: isomiso23gp4
    encoder         : Lavf58.20.100
  Duration: 00:04:22.94, start: 0.138122, bitrate: 15 kb/s
    Stream #0:0: Audio: mp3, 8000 Hz, mono, fltp, 8 kb/s
    Stream #0:1: Video: mjpeg (Baseline), yuvj420p(pc, bt470bg/unknown/unknown), 
    1500x1495 [SAR 1:1 DAR 300:299], 90k tbr, 90k tbn, 90k tbc (attached pic)
    Metadata:
      comment         : Cover (front)
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Content of kodi.log
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ffmpeg[7F6567015700]: [mp3float] Could not update timestamps for skipped samples.
SeekTime - seek ended up on time 0
#+END_EXAMPLE

The solution is to remove the audio file from your bgm playlist. 
If you have chosen a directory in slideshow-bgm settings, edit ~bgm.m3u~ file 
in ~script.slideshow-bgm~ directory(folder) under 
[[https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata#addon_data][addon_data folder]].

*[Update]*
Starting from version 0.4.0, seekTime() function is no longer used.
